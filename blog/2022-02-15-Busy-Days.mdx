These 2 weeks..

My twins turned 3 years old!

A new project from LG America is coming our way.

Bug hunts and juggling a number of tasks! A day in the life!

The S22 / OneUI 4 Simulator for Samsung America is due soon.

Mason, our junior developer got Covid and was out for a few days.

Was asked to pick out a few resumes for another developer to bring into the team.<br />**$ mkdir resumes**<br />**$ searching intensifies**

Samsung Europe's pilot program of the company's **content publishing platform** started .

   The whole project was developed by the two of us.<br/>
    It is quite difficult to do a project of that size with only 2 developers!  ^^;<br/>
    Had to train my junior in frontend React and serverless AWS in that timeline as well, Yikes.

:::
Updated our analytics platform to suit EU regulations.

Converted the <strong>React</strong> template for the published frontends to <strong>Preact</strong>  <br />
